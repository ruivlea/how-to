Power Saving

From this point on I'm going to assume you successfully installed and booted FreeBSD. Log in as root as we can start configuring stuff!

The first order of business is to get some decent battery life. You can see the current battery status using:

acpiconf -i 0

Enabling CPU frequency scaling will give you the biggest power savings. Add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

/etc/rc.conf
powerd_enable="YES"
powerd_flags="-a hiadaptive -b adaptive"
performance_cx_lowest="Cmax"
economy_cx_lowest="Cmax"

Depending on your wireless card, you might be able to enable WiFi power saving in this file as well. Try the following:

/etc/rc.conf
ifconfig_wlan0="WPA DHCP powersave"

There are plenty of power saving kernel tuneables, especially if you have an Intel card:

/boot/loader.conf
hw.pci.do_power_nodriver="3"
hw.snd.latency="7"
hint.p4tcc.0.disabled="1"
hint.acpi_throttle.0.disabled="1"
hint.ahcich.0.pm_level="5"
hint.ahcich.1.pm_level="5"
hint.ahcich.2.pm_level="5"
hint.ahcich.3.pm_level="5"
hint.ahcich.4.pm_level="5"
hint.ahcich.5.pm_level="5"

# for intel cards only
drm.i915.enable_rc6="7"
drm.i915.semaphores="1"
drm.i915.intel_iommu_enabled="1"

Finally, you can set power savings on your USB devices. However, not all of them will support power saving mode. The following shell one-liner will generate a list of commands to enable power saving on all your supported USB devices.

for ugen in $(usbconfig | awk -F: '{print $1}' | sort) ; do cmd="/usr/sbin/usbconfig -d $ugen power_save"; $($cmd 2> /dev/null) && echo $cmd ; done

You can put these commands in /etc/rc.local so they'll run on every boot. Here's what it looks like on my ThinkPad:

/etc/rc.local
/usr/sbin/usbconfig -d ugen1.2 power_save
/usr/sbin/usbconfig -d ugen1.3 power_save
/usr/sbin/usbconfig -d ugen1.4 power_save
/usr/sbin/usbconfig -d ugen1.5 power_save
/usr/sbin/usbconfig -d ugen2.2 power_save

After all that configuration, I get about 8-9 hours of battery life on my ThinkPad, depending on the backlight's brightness.
