How to Resize a Partition using fdisk - Red Hat Customer Portal
5-6 minutes

Prerequisites

    A created partition that you know the name of. To check the name, run cat /etc/fstab. The first field is the name of the partition. The only way to change a partition size using fdisk is by deleting and recreating it so ensure that the information on the file system is backed up.
    Make sure the partition you are resizing is the last partition on a particular disk.

On disks with a GUID Partition Table (GPT), using the parted utility is recommended, as fdisk GPT support is in an experimental phase.
Procedure

1. Unmount the partition:

2. Run fdisk disk_name.

For example:

~]# fdisk /dev/vdb
Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.23.2).

Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them. Be careful before using the write command.

Command (m for help): 

3. Check the partition number you wish to delete with the p. The partitions are listed under the heading “Device”.

For example:

Command (m for help): p
Disk /dev/vda: 407.6 GiB, 437629485056 bytes, 854745088 sectors
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes
Disklabel type: dos
Disk identifier: 0x5c873cba 
Partition 2 does not start on physical sector boundary. 

Device        Boot        Start     End         Blocks      Id    System 
/dev/vda1      *          2048      1026047     512000      83    Linux
/dev/vda2                 1026048   1640447     307200      8e    Linux LVM

4. Use the option d to delete a partition. If there is more than one, fdisk prompts for which one to delete.

For example:

Command (m for help): d
Partition number (1,2, default 2): 2 

Partition 2 has been deleted.

5. Use the option n to create a new partition. Follow the prompts and ensure you allow enough space for any future resizing that is needed. It is possible to specify a set, human-readable size instead of using sectors if this is preferred.

    Note: It is recommended to follow fdisk’s defaults as the default values (for example, the first partition sectors) and partition sizes specified are always aligned according to the device properties.

    Warning: If you are recreating a partition in order to allow for more room on a mounted file system, ensure you create it with the same starting disk sector as before. Otherwise the resize operation will not work and the entire file system may be lost.

For example:

Command (m for help): n 

Partition type: 
  p  primary (1 primary, 0 extended, 3 free) 
  e  extended 
Select (default p): *Enter* 

Using default response p. 
Partition number (2-4, default 2): *Enter*
First sector (1026048-854745087, default 1026048): *Enter* 
Last sector, +sectors or +size{K,M,G,T,P} (1026048-854745087, default 854745087): +500M 

Created a new partition 2 of type 'Linux' and of size 500 MiB.

6. Check the partition table to ensure that the partitions are created as required using the p option.

For example:

Command (m for help): p 
Disk /dev/vda: 407.6 GiB, 437629485056 bytes, 854745088 sectors 
Units: sectors of 1 * 512 = 512 bytes 
Sector size (logical/physical): 512 bytes / 4096 bytes 
I/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 bytes 
Disklabel type: dos 
Disk identifier: 0xf6e2b6cb 

Device        Boot        Start     End         Blocks      Id    System 
/dev/vda1      *          2048      1026047     512000      83    Linux 
/dev/vda2                 1026048   2050047     512000      8e    Linux LVM

7. Write the changes with the w option when you are sure they are correct.

    Important: Errors in this process that are written could cause instability with the selected file system.

8. Run fsck on the partition.
